Next:
  ✔ add Cypress testing, and remove any Jest UI testing @done(20-04-10 22:37)
    have Jest tests for the following
    ✔ unit tests for little functions @done(20-05-07 23:28)
    ☐ test clipboard
    ☐ test tabbing
    ☐ test downloading
    ✔ test custom-colour-schemes.json @done(20-05-07 23:36)
  ☐ Add version log (1: initial, 2: API, 3: UI redesign)
  ☐ Add note in README for contributing codeblocks
  ☐ Maybe host the entire thing on AWS, create monorepo
  ☐ add meta property to theme objects with credits, notes, isDark etc
  ☐ print out colours using canvas, will be easier to make responsive
  ☐ code refactor/tidy
  ☐ use service worker, to make a PWA
  ✔ add percy css ignore to logo @done(20-06-19 19:21)
  ☐ instead of the lame dropdown, all the info should be below the fold of the app
    you scroll down and can see it all
  ✔ make focus outline consistent colours @done(20-06-24 09:47)
    title, info, terminal tabs
  
After:
  ☐ Choose font
  ☐ Add roadmap or todos to readme
  ☐ Add preview type and console tab to share theme parameters
  ☐ favicon match primary/background colours
  ☐ Terminal feature with scanlines etc - experimental.retroTerminalEffect
  ☐ Maybe could be a whole customise Windows Terminal thing - font types, font size, shells
  ☐ Add a proper skeleton loading view, stop lame rendering in <App />

Ideas:
  ☐ add *new* tag
  ☐ add *fixed* schemes, for themes that are have some hard to see colours
    the problem is CRA for instance uses colour names like BrightWhite
    could add a toggle to choose between original and fixed

Testing:
  ☐ check tabbing and accessibility works (https://a11yproject.com/)
